An argument can be used to specify something for the command to act upon. The ls command can be given the name of a directory as an argument, and it will list the contents of that directory. In the next example, the Documents directory will be used as an argument:
```
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls Documents
School           alpha-second.txt  food.txt     linux.txt     os.csv
Work             alpha-third.txt   hello.sh     longfile.txt  people.csv
adjectives.txt   alpha.txt         hidden.txt   newhome.txt   profile.txt
alpha-first.txt  animals.txt       letters.txt  numbers.txt   red.txt
```
