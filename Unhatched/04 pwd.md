# Print working Directory
The pwd command prints the working directory, your current location within the filesystem:

**pwd [OPTIONS]**
```console
sysadmin@localhost:~$ pwd
/home/sysadmin
```

Note: 
~ is equivalent to /home/sysadmin, representing the user's home directory.
```console
sysadmin@localhost:~$
```
