# Basic Command Syntax
A command is a software program that when executed on the CLI (command line interface), performs an action on the computer. When you type in a command, a process is run by the operating system that can read input, manipulate data and produce output. A command runs a process on the operating system, which then causes the computer to perform a job.

The name of the command is often based on what it does or what the developer who created the command thinks will best describe the command's function. For example, the ls command displays a listing of information about files. 

**ls** command displays a listing of information about files.

Notes:
-Every part of the command is normally case-sensitive
-Most commands follow a simple pattern of syntax:  command [options…] [arguments…]
